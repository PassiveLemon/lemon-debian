# lemon-debian </br>
Scripts to install my custom Debian systems. </br>

 - `VERY BIG WIP. Things WILL change. Probably shouldn't use if you aren't me. It works for me, it might not for you.` </br>
 - Only tested on Debian 11 minimal install with wired connection. </br>

# Instructions: </br>
 1. Install Debian with the netinst iso and DO NOT chose a desktop environment.
     - I recommend to install with a blank root password as it will automatically install sudo which will let the scripts run. </br>
 2. Clone this git to a drive, mount it, and navigate into it. </br>
     - This will need to be done from a device that already has an internet connection and can R/W to external drives. It doesn't have to be a thumb drive but thats the simplest way. </br>
 3. Run `syschoose` with bash. Follow the prompts to your liking. </br>

 - Again, this is a very WIP project. Do not expect much. I am not an expert. </br>
 - The scripts should tell you what you need to know. </br>


# Todo / Change: (Ignore) </br>
