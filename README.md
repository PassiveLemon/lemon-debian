# lemon-debian </br>
Scripts to install my custom Debian systems. </br>

 - `VERY BIG WIP. Things WILL change. It works for me, it might not for you.` </br>
 - Only tested on Debian 11 minimal install with wired connection. </br>

# Instructions: </br>
 1. Install Debian with the netinst iso and choose desktop settings: </br>
 I recommend to install with a blank root password as it will automatically install sudo which will let the scripts run. </br>
     - Bspwm: None - No Debian desktop environment </br>
     - Xfce: Xfce - No Debian desktop environment </br>
     - Gnome: None - No Debian desktop environment </br>
 2. Clone this git to a drive, mount it, and navigate into it. </br>
     - You can just directly clone this assuming you have internet or you can put it on a thumb drive, mount it, and cd into it. </br>
 3. Run `setup` with bash. Follow the prompts to your liking. </br>

 - Again, this is a very WIP project. Do not expect much. I am not an expert. </br>
 - The scripts should tell you what you need to know. </br>


# Todo / Change: (Ignore) </br>
 - WIP Xfce DE </br>
