# lemon-debian </br>
Scripts to install my custom Debian systems. </br>

 - `VERY BIG WIP. Probably shouldn't use if you aren't me unless you want to probably encounter bugs. It works for me, it might not for you.` </br>
 - Only tested on Debian 11 minimal install </br>

# Instructions: </br>
 1. Install Debian with the minimal iso and DO NOT chose a desktop environment. </br>
 2. Add the package to a thumb drive, mount it, and navigate into it. </br>
     - This will need to be done from a device that already has an internet connection and that can R/W to thumb drives. It doesn't have to be a thumb drive but thats the simplest way. </br>
 3. Run `mainscript` with bash. This will prepare the system. </br>
     - NOTE: If you aren't me, change "lemon" (line 21) in sudoers (main/config/) to your user account. This also isn't entirely necessary but that depends on your conditions. </br>
 4. After the restart, run `syschoose` with bash. You will be presented with options. Choose the appropriate options that suits your needs. </br>

 - Again, this is a very WIP project. Do not expect much. I am not an expert. </br>
 - The scripts should tell you what you need to know. </br>
