# lemon-debian
Scripts to install my custom Debian systems. </br>

VERY BIG WIP. Don't use if you aren't me unless you want to probably encounter bugs. </br>
Tested on Debian 11 minimal install

# Instructions: </br>
Install Debian with the minimal iso and do not chose a DE. </br>
Add the package to a thumb drive (or other transferable medium) and mount it. </br>
Navigate into the package and run mainscript.sh (NOTE: If you aren't me, edit the script and change all mentions of "lemon" to your user account) to set up the OS. </br>
After the restart, choose either bspwm or Gnome and run the respective, scriptbspwm.sh or scriptgnome.sh script. Don't run both. </br>
After the second restart, run the respective, appsbspwm.sh or appsgnome.sh. Like previously, don't run both. </br>

Todo: (Ignore) </br>
desktop wifi script </br>
custom TUI's - steam, spotify, discord, reddit </br>
apps + configs </br> 
nvidia driver </br>
headless server scripts for vms </br>
optimize script </br>
^ integrate bspwm and gnome into one script with a choice </br>
possibly fragment the scripts into individual scripts for each app. </br>
